. https://github.com/sunilsoni/cracking-the-coding-interview/blob/master/src/com/ctci6/ch01/IsUniqueChars.java[Is Unique:] Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?.

. https://github.com/sunilsoni/cracking-the-coding-interview/blob/master/src/com/ctci6/ch01/Permutation.java[Check Permutation:] Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other.

. https://github.com/sunilsoni/cracking-the-coding-interview/blob/master/src/com/ctci6/ch01/URLify.java[URLify:] Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%2e: You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. 
Note:: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
perform this operation in place.
