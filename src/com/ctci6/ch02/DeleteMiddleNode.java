 * Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (Le., any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) 
 * of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
 * <p>EXAMPLE:</p>
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * Input: the node c from the linked list a - >b- >c - >d - >e- >f
 * Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e->f
