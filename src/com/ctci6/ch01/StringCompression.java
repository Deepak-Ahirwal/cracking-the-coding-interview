 * Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts

 * The string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. </pre></blockquote>
 * If the "compressed"string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
 * the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).
